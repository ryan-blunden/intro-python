# Weather Code Challenge
#
# - Ask for the user for the city, country.
# - Call the http://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast API using `requests` to extract the relevant data.
# - Output a nice message back to the user, telling them what the weather is like.
#
# BONUS:
# -  Ask them what unit they would like the temperature in.
# - Validate their choice of country code by loading in `data/country_codes.csv`.
# - Supply some extra advice (e.g, if its raining, say ‘better bring your umbrella’)
# - If you were to package this in a module for other users to use, you would not want to hard-code the `API key`. How could you make this configurable?
# - Use the Python `click` library to learn about building scalable `CLI` applications.
