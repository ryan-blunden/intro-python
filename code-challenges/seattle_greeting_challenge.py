# Seattle Greeting Code Challenge
#  - Ask for the city the user comes from.
#  - If they say (not case sensitive) “seattle”, output a friendly message
#  - If not, say a message welcoming them to Seattle
#  - If they do not answer at all: write to `stderr` saying that a response is required and exit with code `1`
